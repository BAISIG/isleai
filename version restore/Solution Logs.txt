Problem: the screen is half its original size and i can see the global background blue and black gradient

The issue you're seeing — where the screen appears half its original size and you're seeing the global background gradient (blue/black) — is due to this line in your Playground.jsx layout:

jsx
Copy
Edit
maxWidth: "1200px", // Reduced width
This line restricts the main container to a max width of 1200px and centers it using margin: "0 auto". On wide screens, it won’t fill the full screen, exposing the background.

✅ Fix: Make the app fill the entire screen width
If you want your app to stretch across the full width and avoid seeing the background:

Replace this:

jsx
Copy
Edit
maxWidth: "1200px",
With this:

jsx
Copy
Edit
width: "100vw",
maxWidth: "100vw",
Or completely remove maxWidth and margin: "0 auto" from the outer <div> style.

Optional (Background Gradient Removal)
If you don’t want the background gradient at all (in case it’s defined globally in your CSS), you can override it at the root level:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div
  style={{
    padding: 0,
    height: "100vh",
    width: "100vw",
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    fontFamily:
      "Inter, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Ubuntu, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif",
    background: "#f9fafb", // This overrides the global gradient
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}

Let me know if you want to keep it centered but still expand it wider on larger screens.
